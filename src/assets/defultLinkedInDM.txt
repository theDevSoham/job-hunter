Hi {{connection_name}},

I hope you're doing well. I came across your profile and noticed your work at {{target_company_name}}. I’m a {{previous_role}} with experience in {{skills_experienced_in(comma_separated)}} and more—having recently contributed to {{noable_recent_contribution_in_last_company}}.

I’m very interested in exploring {{target_opportunity}} opportunity at {{target_company_name}} and would appreciate it if you could refer me for the role. My resume (attached/available on my profile) provides further details on my background and projects.

Thank you for your time and consideration!
